# chatbot

A simple chat client written in cycle. To run the app locally just clone, install requirements, and run the app. You should be able to interact with the app on localhost:5000.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zyskowsk/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

You can also play around with the app [here](http://rob-chatbot.herokuapp.com/) (chrome > 45.0).
